DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE RATIONALE:
========================================================================================================================

1. MOTION METRICS (velocity, acceleration, gyro magnitudes):
   - Drone telemetry fundamentally tracks motion in 3D space
   - Individual components may be noisy; magnitude captures overall motion intensity
   - DoS attacks and malfunctions manifest as unusual motion patterns

2. BATTERY METRICS (drain rate, voltage stability):
   - Battery state is critical for fault detection
   - Sudden voltage drops indicate electrical faults
   - Abnormal drain rates suggest motor/system issues

3. CONTROL METRICS (RC output mean/std, throttle-altitude ratio):
   - RC signals represent pilot/autopilot commands
   - Asymmetric motor outputs (high std) indicate flight instability
   - Throttle-altitude relationship tracks control compliance

4. TEMPORAL FEATURES (sample index, altitude rate):
   - Sequential patterns may differentiate normal vs anomalous behavior
   - Rate of altitude change is more informative than absolute altitude

5. INTEGRATED METRICS (motion_activity_level):
   - Combines multiple motion sources into single activity indicator
   - Useful for rapid anomaly detection (sudden activity spikes)

FEATURE ENGINEERING IMPACT:
========================================================================================================================

Features added: 10
Original sparse features removed: -1
Net feature count change: +10 (after sparse column removal)

Key Benefits:
  ✓ Reduces dimensionality by removing high-sparsity features
  ✓ Increases interpretability with domain-meaningful features
  ✓ Captures non-linear relationships through magnitude features
  ✓ Temporal patterns encoded through rate-of-change and sequence features
  ✓ Better suited for anomaly detection (DoS attacks, malfunctions)
